# Introduction
This project serves as a CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter.
The aim of this project is to introduce myself, and anyone following, to systems emulation.
This project will (aim to) use best practices in C++, and best practices in git (good commit messages.)

# Building the project
Please use an out of source build method, for example:
```
mkdir build
cd ./build
cmake ../
make
```

and to run the project (relative to the new build folder we made):
```
./bin/CHIP8
```
